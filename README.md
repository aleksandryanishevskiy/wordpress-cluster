* **Web Application Firewall** will be enabled by the default if **LiteSpeed Web Server** will be installed
* The *WordPress* application itself is handled by either **LiteSpeed Web Server** or **[NGINX PHP](https://docs.jelastic.com/nginx-php)** servers with preconfigured [automatic horizontal scaling](https://docs.jelastic.com/automatic-horizontal-scaling) to handle load spikes  
* **Redis** is high-performance RAM-allocated data structure store used as a highspeed caching solution
* Highly-available **[MariaDB Galera Cluster](https://github.com/jelastic-jps/mysql-cluster#mariadb-galera-cluster)** is used to store and operate user data   
* **[Shared Storage](https://docs.jelastic.com/shared-storage-container)** cluster, ensuring high avaiablity with GlusterFS, is mounted to all application server nodes for sharing common data  
* Traffic encryption is provided by [Let's Encrypt Add-On](https://jelastic.com/blog/free-ssl-certificates-with-lets-encrypt/)  with automatic issuing of trusted SSL certificate and Auto-Renewal.
